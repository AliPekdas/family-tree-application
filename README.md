The Family Tree Warehouse Application (FTWA) creates and manages family trees. The FTWA tracks the ancestral hierarchy of the user’s family.

Rules of application:
•	User can update members. Update operation can be performed for just the birth and death dates.
•	User can add new members as child.
•	Each person keeps the following information: gender, name, surname, birth date, death date, father, mother, child/children.
•	User can reach the following information: alive or dead, age, the level in the family tree.
•	The application displays the tree as a diagram.
•	The application displays the relationship types between two people.
•	Anyone can marry with anyone in the family tree except father, mother, sibling, uncle, aunt and grandparents. If a marriage violates this rule, the program warns the user and reject the marriage.
•	Birth and death dates are realistic. For instance, a person cannot have a child after he/she dies. The application doesn’t allow non-realistic birth and death dates and warns the user.
•	The program warns the user and rejects the marriage if any of the spouse is below 18 years old.
•	There cannot be two people having both the same name and surname.
•	Only the husband and wife at the root of the family tree can be hardcoded. All other family members will be added by the user while the program is running.
